#**Crowdfunding Analysis**

##Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to look at previous Kickstarter data to help Louise determine how she should set up her kickstarter for success. The data includes various factors such as time of launch, goal and pledge amounts, categories, and overall outcome. 

##Analysis

###Category Analysis

Starting off with the data was daunting considering how much was provided. However, through careful analysis, we were able to at least narrow it down to what is most relevant to what Louise is considering. Categories is a huge factor that may skew data. For example, if we were to look at the overall success factor and goal amounts of every single Kickstarter, our analysis may be incorrect as there could be a certain category that has a higher rate of failure. We cannot assume that a technology Kickstarter would perform the same as a play kickstarter; therefore, we need a comparison.
In this chart, we are able to compare the outcomes of Kickstarters based off their category. Just by viewing this chart, we are able to see that the theater category has a much higher ratio of success compared to a different category such as food. If Louise was on the fence when it came to the type of Kickstarter she'd like to launch, seeing this would help her make a decision. This chart shows that food Kickstarters have a higher rate of failure, whereas categories such as film and video, music, and theater have a higher rate of success. This is sure to make Louise feel at ease!

###Goal Analysis

After confirming that a theater project would be good for Louise, we needed to break down the main key points of a Kickstarter: how much should we be asking for and when should we ask for it? To test this, we compared the outcomes of Kickstarters based on how much they set their goal at. In this chart, we can see that those that asked for more than $45,000 were more likely to fail.

###Launch Date Analysis

After budgeting and determining how much her goal should be, here is a chart to help Louise decide when a good launch time would be. Failure seems to remain around the same count throughout the year, however, there is a large spike in success during May. The number of successful Kickstarters seem to stay in a high range through to July. Could it be that people are more likely to contribute to a theater project during the summer, when summer vacation is happening and parents would like for more activities for their children? Either way, it would be most beneficial to Louise if she were to launch her Kickstarter sometime then.

###Challenges

Overall, the analysis of this research seemed straight forward. I had several issues myself trying to understand outliers in the data. This was my first time working with IQR, as my past experience involved only working with standard deviation as a method for spotting outliers. Through practice, research, and the help of creating charts in Excel, however, I was able to properly visualize what could be outliers. One challenge that I may see coming up is location. For Louise, if she were to see that another country has a much higher chance of success than the US for her project, would she consider (or even have the means) to hold her Kickstarter there instead? Location is one variable that we did not deep dive, but that may be due to Louise's permanent location here in the US. 

##Result

###Launch Timeframe

Based off the Theater Outcomes vs Launch, Louise should launch her project in May. She should definitely avoid launching in December, as those launched during that month seem to show similar rates of success and failure. 

###Goal Amount

Through the Outcomes vs Goals, we are able to help Louise determine the general range of her goal. There are two sweet spots where the percentage of success remains above 60%, and the percentage of failure is at 20%. If Louise were to play it at its safest, she should set her goal at less than $5,000. If she feels the need that her project is not sustainable at that amount but still wants to paly it safe, we would recommend that she set her goal between $35,000 and $50,000.

###More Recommendations

All of these results and recommendations are based on the Kickstarter data that we have pulled. It is important to note that we only looked at the main factors such as category, goal, and launch time. Additional factors if Louise decides to move forward with this goal include what type of genre her play should be (comedy, drama, family friendly, etc.) and how long she should have her project running. It would be good to run further analysis on those two factors that may make or break her Kickstarter.
